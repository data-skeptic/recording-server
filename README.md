# Recording Server

A server-side application which facilitates in-browser audio recording and persistence.  The Recording Server is meant to be lightweight but extensible as a generic service.

For example, a product manager wishing to make software that helps cartoon producers collect and store the audio performances of actors and actresses could start with this base.  This application will have no variables with name like `actor`.  Instead this service provides only basic, fundamental recording services for in-browser use cases.
